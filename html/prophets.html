                    <p>There were stones falling from the mountain blocking the way in front of them, so Jesus placed his generous hand on the stones, and his hand was imprinted on them,
                         and therefore the mountain is now called the mountain of the hand.
                         The stones were split from a path in which the Holy Family walked,
                          and it is now called Maryam’s Crack, and a church was built later in the name of the Virgin on the top of the mountain
